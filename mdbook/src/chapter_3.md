== Initialization ==
extruder -> rail : Check home position
rail -> rail : Move to start position
press -> press : Ensure open position

== Production Cycle ==
group Continuous Process
    extruder -> extruder : Start material feed
    extruder -> haul_off : Synchronize speed
    
    loop Every cycle
        rail -> press : Position 0 reached
        press -> press : Close mold
        rail -> rail : Move to end position
        
        alt Rail at end position
            press -> press : Open mold
            rail -> rail : Return to start
            cutter -> cutter : Cut product

== Emergency Stop ==
note over extruder, cutter
    Any component can trigger E-stop
    All movements stop immediately

This diagram illustrates the linear extrusion process flow, showing the interaction between:
- Extruder
- Linear Rail System
- Press
- Haul Off
- Cutter

The process includes initialization, continuous production cycle, and emergency stop handling.
