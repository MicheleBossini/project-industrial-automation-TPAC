# Risk assessment

First, some definitions will be discussed out of Dutch safety Norm "NEN-EN-ISO 13849-1:2023 Veiligheid van machines - Onderdelen van besturingssystemen met een veiligheidsfunctie" regarding hazard, harm and risks.</br>

Hazard: Potential source of harm. </br>

Harm: Physical injury or damage to health. </br>

Risk: Combination fo the probability of the occurance of harm and the sevirity of that harm. </br>

Risk analysis: combination of the specification of the limits of the machine, hazard identification and risk estimation. </br>

Risk evaluation: judgement, on the basis of risk analysis, of whether risk reduction objectives have been achieved. </br>

Risk assessment: overall process comprising risk analysis and risk evaluation. </br>

After the final design was chosen, the limits of the machine where summed up in a table together with the hazards caused by those limits. the consequences where noted. Then, the risk was given a grade between 1-25, determined by the product of grading the effect and the chance of the risk both between 1-5. Then a potential measure is thought of, and the risk is graded again, with measure.

## Effect (Impact/Severity) – Scale 1 to 5
1: Minimal damage or injury, no medical treatment needed
2: Minor injury, short medical treatment required
3: Moderate injury, hospitalization possible, temporary disability
4: Severe injury, long-term disability or permanent damage, burning wounds
5: Fatal or permanent disability, loss of limbs, death

## Chance (Probability) – Scale 1 to 5
1: Very unlikely
2: Unlikely
3: Possible
4: Likely
5: Very likely

## Risk = Effect × Chance – Scale 1 to 25
1–5: Low risk, acceptable without immediate action
6–10: Moderate risk, improvements recommended
11–15: High risk, action required within a reasonable timeframe
16–20: Very high risk, immediate action required
21–25: Critical risk, stop immediately and implement solution
