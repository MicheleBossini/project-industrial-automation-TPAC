# Performance level

Performance Level (PL) refers to the ability of a machine control system to perform its safety-related functions reliably under defined conditions. It expresses how effectively the system can prevent hazardous situations by detecting faults and responding correctly.


In this project, the synchronization system represents the core control element and is connected to all machine components, including the extruder, infrared lamp, haul-off system, press, moving rails, cylinder, and temperature control. All operational data—such as speed, position, temperature, and actuator status—flows through the synchronization system.

The required performance level ensures that:

 - Material speed, rail movement, and pressing actions are correctly coordinated.
 - The infrared lamp and cooling system maintain safe and stable material temperature.
 - The press cylinder operates only when the rails are in the correct position.
 - Any abnormal condition or fault can be detected and managed to prevent unsafe operation.
