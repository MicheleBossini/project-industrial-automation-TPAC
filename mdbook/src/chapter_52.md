# Future improvements

This project provided valuable technical and process-oriented lessons that will guide future work. Below we summarise concrete improvements we will prioritise, and reflect on key lessons learned that emerged during development and delivery.

Lessons learned

- Breaking the system into sub-functions significantly improved our ability to reason about behaviour. This modularity revealed conections to the demands of the costumer we had not fully anticipated and clear.
- Coupling technical choices to explicit customer demands clarified trade-offs between cost, performance, and complexity. When trade-offs were documented and reviewed with the client, decisions were more robust.
- Work together with a team of diverse backgrounds. That not have the same base knowlege. To help each outher understand the process and use our skills where they are best put to use.
By adopting these improvements we expect to reduce the time it takes to get a desing. The lessons learned from this project strengthen our engineering practices.
