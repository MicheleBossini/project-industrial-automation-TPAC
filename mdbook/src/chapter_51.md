# Self-evaluation

As our group did not managed to build our system in the time we had, it is hard to say if we did a good job or not.</br>
But we managed to deliver a design, which we think is the best based on our research work. The design choices that we made, were based on:
- our analysis of the problem
- the functions and subfunctions of our system
- a morphological table with all the possible solutions to the functions
- a Kesselringen table, that confirmed the best design to choose </br>

As we had this done, we needed to make the design we choosen, the best that we could have. Therefore, we have made calculations about the cooling and heating time, the pressure that we need on the plate to be pressed and the material flow, so that we know how much we could produce.</br>
After this, we have summurized our work in a CAD model, to have a virtual image of our machine. We also made a PLC program, capable of sychronizing and regulating the process with the extruder.</br>
We did most of the prvious searching work and brainstorming togheter in many group meetings and after we all felt confortable with the subject, everyone got parts of the project to work on individualy.
So, this was a little overview on how we worked during this project. We also had a weekly meeting with our custumer.

In this group project, I worked with three people who did not have the same background as I did. Although I had worked in multidisciplinary groups before, this experience was different because I was not working with other mechanical engineers whom I already knew.</br>

At the start of the project, I assumed that my teammates would follow the same design steps that I was familiar with. However, I quickly realized that they had never worked on a project like this before. This created a challenge for me, as I had to explain many aspects of the design process to them. Doing this required significantly more effort than simply completing the work on my own. At times, I felt that if I had not explained or assisted, certain tasks might not have been completed.</br>

On the other hand, my teammates also brought valuable skills that I did not yet possess, particularly in electronics. Even though they were unfamiliar with this specific design methodology, we were able to discuss ideas, debate design choices, and explain our reasoning to one another. This helped us develop better solutions as a team.</br>

Overall, the group dynamic was very positive. We worked well together, communicated clearly, and made solid agreements. No one avoided contributing to the project, which I appreciated, as this is not always the case in group work.</br>

In future projects with people from different backgrounds, I will first try to determine everyone’s level of knowledge and experience with the design process. Despite our different backgrounds and skill sets, we collaborated effectively and successfully developed a final design together.</br>


## Michele 
As you know, I started this minor without any prior experience in project work or mechanical design. However, through this project I feel that I learned a great deal, such as teamwork, organization, design and concept selection, thermoplastic materials, the morphological table, Kesselring graduation, the importance of constant progress, and especially how to approach a project like this from the very beginning in order to reassure the customer and make the concept as clear and solid as possible.</br>

I tried to put in as much effort as possible and to help wherever I could. I truly wanted to actively contribute to this project, even though I know that my contribution was less technical than that of my teammates. I had some difficulties with the language and communication, but I believe I did a good job, and my teammates helped me a lot throughout the process.</br>

Overall, this experience was very positive and valuable for me. It helped me improve my skills, and gain more confidence in working on projects and collaborating in a team, while also giving me a better understanding of how real design projects are developed in a professional environment.</br>

I found this project very interesting and very challenging. As I had no previous experience in designing group projects, this project brought me a lot of knowledge in many aspects: thermoplastics,design process, communication, professional environment and team working. </br>

As I am also a mechanical engineer, but with a different background, I always tried to ask questions about the other's ideas to make sure that I really understand what they ment, to see if I agree on that and to add something to the idea. This was definitly a good way to work for me, espascialy in this international group where missunderstanding can easely happened. </br>

So I will left the Netherlands with a great experience eventhough we did not finish everything in this project!</br>
