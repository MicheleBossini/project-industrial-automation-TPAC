# Risk assessment

First, some definitions will be discussed out of Dutch safety Norm "NEN-EN-ISO 13849-1:2023 Veiligheid van machines - Onderdelen van besturingssystemen met een veiligheidsfunctie" regarding hazard, harm and risks.</br>

Hazard: Potential source of harm. </br>

Harm: Physical injury or damage to health. </br>

Risk: Combination fo the probability of the occurance of harm and the sevirity of that harm. </br>

Risk analysis: combination of the specification of the limits of the machine, hazard identification and risk estimation. </br>

Risk evaluation: judgement, on the basis of risk analysis, of whether risk reduction objectives have been achieved. </br>

Risk assessment: overall process comprising risk analysis and risk evaluation. </br>

After the final design was chosen, the limits of the machine where summed up in a table together with the hazards caused by those limits. the consequences where noted. Then, the risk was given a grade between 1-25, determined by the product of grading the effect and the chance of the risk both between 1-5. Then a potential measure is thought of, and the risk is graded again, with measure.

## Effect (Impact/Severity) – Scale 1 to 5
1: Minimal damage or injury, no medical treatment needed</br>
2: Minor injury, short medical treatment required</br>
3: Moderate injury, hospitalization possible, temporary disability</br>
4: Severe injury, long-term disability or permanent damage, burning wounds</br>
5: Fatal or permanent disability, loss of limbs, death</br>

## Chance (Probability) – Scale 1 to 5
1: Very unlikely</br>
2: Unlikely</br>
3: Possible</br>
4: Likely</br>
5: Very likely</br>

## Risk = Effect × Chance – Scale 1 to 25
1–5: Low risk, acceptable without immediate action</br>
6–10: Moderate risk, improvements recommended</br>
11–15: High risk, action required within a reasonable timeframe</br>
16–20: Very high risk, immediate action required</br>
21–25: Critical risk, stop immediately and implement solution</br>
