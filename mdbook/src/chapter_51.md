# Self-evaluation

As our group did not managed to build our system in the time we had, it is hard to say if we did a good job or not.</br>
But we managed to deliver a design, which we think is the best based on our research work. The design choices that we made, were based on:
- our analysis of the problem
- the functions and subfunctions of our system
- a morphological table with all the possible solutions to the functions
- a Kesselringen table, that confirmed the best design to choose </br>

As we had this done, we needed to make the design we choosen, the best that we could have. Therefore, we have made calculations about the cooling and heating time, the pressure that we need on the plate to be pressed and the material flow, so that we know how much we could produce.</br>
After this, we have summurized our work in a CAD model, to have a virtual image of our machine. We also made a PLC program, capable of sychronizing and regulating the process with the extruder.</br>
We did most of the prvious searching work and brainstorming togheter in many group meetings and after we all felt confortable with the subject, everyone got parts of the project to work on individualy.
So, this was a little overview on how we worked during this project. We also had a weekly meeting with our custumer.
