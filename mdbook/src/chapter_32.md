participant "User"
participant "Extruder" as extruder
participant "Infrared Lamp" as InfraredLamp
participant "Linear Rail" as rail
participant "Press" as press
participant "Cylinder" 
participant "Haul Off" as haul_off
participant "Cooling System" as CoolingSystem
participant "Synchronization"


== Initialization ==
User -> Synchronization : Start the machine
extruder -> Synchronization : Material speed
Synchronization -> haul_off : Speed Synchronization
Synchronization -> rail : Speed Synchronization
Synchronization -> InfraredLamp : Start heating, and keep the desired position
InfraredLamp -> Synchronization : Temperature reached
Synchronization -> haul_off : Start pullung material
Synchronization -> CoolingSystem : Start colling, and keep to the desire position

== Production Cycle ==
group Continuous Process
    User -> extruder : Start material feed
    
    loop Every cycle
        Synchronization -> rail : Home position
        opt Rail at start position 
        rail -> Synchronization : Initial position reached
        Synchronization -> Cylinder : Close mold
        Synchronization -> rail : Move to end position
        end
        opt Rail at end position
            rail -> Synchronization : Final Position reached
            Synchronization -> Cylinder : Open mold
            Synchronization -> rail : Return to start
        end
    end
end

== Emergency Stop ==
note over extruder, Synchronization
    Any component can trigger E-stop
    All movements stop immediately
end note

This diagram illustrates the linear extrusion process flow, showing the interaction between:
- Extruder
- Linear Rail System
- Press and cylinder
- Haul Off
- Cooling and heating system 
- Saffety alarm and emergency stop

The process includes initialization, continuous production cycle, and emergency stop handling.
